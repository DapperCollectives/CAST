        Cookies and Other Similar Technologies

      <strong className="has-text-black">International Data Transfers</strong>
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2">
      Personal information collected by Dapper may be transferred, stored, and
      processed in Canada, the U.S., or in any other country where Dapper or its
      affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities, in
      which case the information may be subject to the laws of that
      jurisdiction. Some countries we transfer personal information to may not
      be as protective as the country you reside in; however, we have taken the
      appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of your personal
      information. For example, if we transfer personal information from the EEA
      or UK to a country that has not been deemed to have an adequate level of
      data protection, we will implement an appropriate data transfer solution
      such as entering into EU standard contractual clauses or other measures to
      comply with applicable EU law.{' '}

      <strong className="has-text-black">Data Retention</strong>

    <p className="mb-2">
      We take reasonable efforts to protect your personal information using
      appropriate physical, technological and organizational safeguards. No
      security is foolproof, and the Internet is an insecure medium. However, we
      work hard to protect you from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure,
      and destruction of your personal information collected by us. As such, we
      have policies, procedures, guidelines, and safeguards in place to ensure
      your personal information is protected.{' '}

      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the
      age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal
      information for a child under the age of 13, we will delete it, unless we
      are legally obligated to retain such information. If you are a parent or
      guardian of a child and you become aware that a child has provided
